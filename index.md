### IT 272 Cross-Platform Technologies

---------------------------------------------------

<strong>What are Cross-Platform Technologies?</strong>

Cross-platform technology is a phrase that is applied broadly across a number
of contexts in Information Technology, Computer Science, and Business. Simply stated: <strong>Cross-platform
technologies are software and hardware systems that allow for functionality across a number of
underlying operating platforms.</strong>

<em><strong>Virtualization (computing)</strong></em>

<em>Virtualization</em> is a process in computing that allows one computer or server to use more than one operating system or application simultaneously. In its various forms, virtualization has greatly affected how people use computers, servers, networks, storage devices, and other technologies. It has made technology more efficient, allowing one computer to take on the strength of many. This in turn has increased profits and productivity as well as reduced costs and waste for many companies and individuals.

# <strong>Uses and Types</strong>

Virtualization allows one computer or server to use multiple operating systems or applications at the same time. It accomplishes this through software that virtually simulates the existence of other computers and applications that do not exist in the physical world. Through this virtual system, a single physical computer can run multiple operating systems or applications. In effect, virtualization allows one computer to do the work and access the capabilities of multiple computers.

<mark>Four important facts of computing:</mark>
<ol>
  <li> <em>Network virtualization</em> allows a physical computer network to be virtually simulated through software, offering a single computer the capabilities and services of an entire network of computers. </li>
  <li> <em>Server virtualization</em> allows one server to use multiple operating systems and applications, thus reducing the need for numerous machines and all the necessary upkeep.</li>
  <li> <em>Desktop virtualization</em> allows single computers or other devices to access information and abilities from other sources, allowing, for instance, a company to provide virtual desktops to mobile and outsource workers to keep everyone working on the same project with the same tools and data.</li>
  <li> <em>Storage virtualization</em> gathers data from many sources and stores it in a safe place that is accessible to any number of registered users. </li>
</ol>

Storage virualization is similar to cloud computing, one of the most popular uses of virtualization.
<em>Cloud computing</em> computer users connect devices to a virtual cloud, or a storage area containing software and data that is accessible to users at any time or place through any Internet-capable device. It allows companies greater flexibility and saves money on hardware, software, and maintenance.

# Effects of Virtualization

Virtualization is a major part of the computing and technology industries and appears in a wide range of fields. For instance, the government uses virtualization to connect its many agencies and respond to the needs of citizens more efficiently. Schools use virtualization to organize and prepare computer labs and help off-site students access the materials they need for lessons. Hospitals and health care organizations use virtualization to keep patient records secure yet accessible to medical professionals. Manufacturers, retailers, and banks use virtualization to manage inventory, regulate branch offices, and offer new and more efficient services.

<mar>Reasons companies choose virtualization:</mark>
<ol>
  <li> Primary reason is efficiency</li>
  <li> Machines that previoulsy used only 15% of their capabilities can use 80% with proper virtualization.</li>
  <li> Reduce the need for costly extra machines, upkeep and energy = reduce expenditures.</li>
  <li> Reduce number of machines = less waste and energy requirements; cuts down environmental wear and damage.</li>
  <li> Once correctly set up, may make software installation and system administration much simplier.</li>
</ol>

# Pros and Cons of Virtualization

<strong>PROS:</strong>

<ul>
  <li> Scalability: combines multiple systems.</li>
  <li> Server Consolidation: Reduces the need of physical computers, while still providing the systems and specifications required to operate efficiently.</li>
  <li> Improved system Reliability: the ability to help prevent system crashes.</li>
  <li> Virtual WorkStations: allows for the operation of multiple systems on a single machine, allow for remote operations of your systems. Also reduces desktop footprint and hardware expenditure.</li>
</ul>

<strong>CONS:</strong>

<ul>
  <li> Programs that require Physcial Hardware: With any programs that require physical hardware, virtualization won’t suit well.</li>
  <li> Performance Quality Can Decrease: If you’re running an application that is running up RAM usage or CPU utilization, virtualization could cause a lag in performance.  A VM runs in layers on its hosting systems so unless you use one program or server, any operation using extreme performance will see a lowered quality of performance. </li>
  <li> Testing is critical: The purpose of IT is really to drive your business goals, so you wouldn’t want to rely on an untested platform for programs that keep your business running. This is especially true for virtualization because once it malfunctions, it’s not like you can turn it off and back on again.</li>
  <li> Unexpected Expenses: Initially, virtualization may appear to save you a bit of money.  But, this is a process that takes effort and should be done properly the first time.  In order to account for that attention to time and detail, you may be spending more than originally anticipated.</li>
