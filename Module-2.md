# Third-party Risks Management

Third-party risk management (TPRM) is the program that an organization uses to assess and manage its risks posed by third-party products and services. 

A properly functioning TPRM program would involve the organization's Chief Information Security Officer - as manager od data security risk - in the Procurement process before contracting. 

They'll determine:

<ul>
  <li> How the third party will be accessing, storing or transmitting the organization's data</li>
  <li> Whether it has a control environment that meets the organization's expectations or needs to be enhanced</li> 
  <li> If specific requirements should be negotiated into the contract</li>
</ul> 

The #1 success factor for TPRM programs is the focusing of time, effort, and expertise on the highest-risk third-party services.
