## <strong>Module 2</strong>

In this module, you'll compare the advantages, disadvantages, and risks of creating virtual computing environments on the premesies to using a third-part vendor. This is a comparison that an organization has to consider when it decideds to virtualize. You will also learn about Hyper-V and VMware, and how they deploy virtual machines.

# Third-party Risks Management

Third-party risk management (TPRM) is the program that an organization uses to assess and manage its risks posed by third-party products and services. 

A properly functioning TPRM program would involve the organization's Chief Information Security Officer - as manager od data security risk - in the Procurement process before contracting. 

They'll determine:

<ul>
  <li> How the third party will be accessing, storing or transmitting the organization's data</li>
  <li> Whether it has a control environment that meets the organization's expectations or needs to be enhanced</li> 
  <li> If specific requirements should be negotiated into the contract</li>
</ul> 

The #1 success factor for TPRM programs is the focusing of time, effort, and expertise on the highest-risk third-party services.

## Four Key Server Virtualization Strategy Decisions

Infrastructure and operations leaders must develop their server virtualization infrastructures to drive down costs and improve agility, based on changing business needs and innovation.

The four decision areas are:

<ol>
  <li> Alternate hypervisor technology</li>
  <li> Containers</li>
  <li> Cloud computing</li>
  <li> Hyperconvergence</li>
</ol>

## Impacts

<ul>
  <li> The competition for x86 server virtualization infrastructure has matured, creating viable alternatives, based on cost, functionality and infrastructure strategies, for infrastructure and operations leaders</li>
  <li> Containers are becoming a preffered framework for developers and a potential infrastructure consolidation technology for I&O leaders</li>
  <li>The public cloud has become an attractive option that enables I&O leaders to acquire virtual capacity as a service, rather than owning and managing their own infrastructures</li>
  <li> The tight packaging of software-defined computing and storage, combined with operational simplicity, has made hyperconvergence a popular delivery method for I&O leaders involved with virtualized infrastructures</li>
</ul>

## Four things to know about VMware Cloud and AWS

Adoption of VMware Cloud on AWS is growing. Infrastructure and operations leaders focused on reducing data center capital expenses should view VMware Cloud on AWS as a viable alternative â€” especially for applications that are difficult or expensive to transform to native cloud.

<ul>
  <li> VMware Cloud on AWS offers VMware Cloud Foundation (VCF) as a service, enabling cloud migration with few to no changes in application architectures or operations.</li>
  <li> Clients are unlikely to see overall cost reductions from using VMware Cloud on AWS, but will shift expenses from fixed capital expenditure (capex) to flexible operating expenditure (opex).</li>
  <li> VMware Cloud on AWS is more expensive than native AWS for new, highly agile applications.</li>
  <li> VMware Cloud on AWS is strategic and important for VMware and AWS today, and for at least the next three to four years as the alliance generates new integrations and integrated offerings.</li>
</ul>
